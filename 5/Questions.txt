Question #1
Since this is a homework assignment and not a research project, we are skipping several important 
considerations that would be essential for a real user study. List three modifications that would
need to be made to the experimental method in Part 2 to make it a properly controlled study. 

1: First of all, as a homework assignment, our sample size may not be large enough to reflect
the true statistics of the entire population. As we only obtained a totoal of 42 (including
both expert and typical users) users for the study, the sample size needs to be considerably
larger for a real user study.
2: Our study is not necessarily reprentative of the real usages of the different OSs and browsers
among the users. Take the Firefox browser for example, our study only included one expert user 
and one typical user using the Firefox browser. However, in reality, there may be a noticably
higher portion of users that use Firefox. As a result, the study need to improve by selecting
samples that are actually representative of the real OS and browser usages.
3: The individuals that we surveyed in this study is not necessarily diverse enough to be
considered as a real user study. Take the age range of the expert users for example,
the average age for these users is around 23 which leans significantly closer towards the
younger users. As a result, our study may not be inclusive enough of expert users in other
age group and improving similar diversities in our sample can contribute towards a real
user study.

Question #2
Provide a caption for your figure with the data from Part 1. 


Average User Interactions Needed to Perform Privacy Customization Activities in Web Browsers
and Smartphones.

Question #3
Provide a caption for your figure with the data from Part 2. 


Average User Time Needed to Perform Privacy Customization Activities in Web Browsers
and Smartphones (for Expert Users and Typical Users).

Question #4
Choose one takeaway from the data and figures. Describe its implications for software developers
and designers attempting to balance privacy customization options and user-friendliness.


One key observation from the two figures is that, while iOS smartphone appear to require less
interactions to perform privacy customization activities such as location service and
advertising ID compared to Android devices, it actually takes longer (in terms of time) for the
typical users to perform these actions (as shown in Part2Figure). One possible reason that can
contribute to this is that, while iOS devices allow the users to access these privacy settings
through fewer interactions, the devices themselves may not provide sufficiently enough hints
(such as obvious icons and setting names) that actually aid the users when they attempt to perform 
these privacy customization tasks. On the other hand, although the Android devices require more
interactions, the typical Android users actually appear to take less time to perform these 
activities. As a result, it may be worth looking to the difference between these Smartphone
OSs' designs that combine the advantages of both OSs to create privacy setting interfaces 
that provide both few interactions and higher user-friendliness.

How did you divide the work between partners? (Put N/A if worked alone)

We splitted work and peer reviewed our conclusions.
